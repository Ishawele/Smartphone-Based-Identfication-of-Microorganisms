## 📄 Abstract

This project presents a low-cost, smartphone-based microscope designed using simple materials like plywood, plexiglass, and a laser pointer lens. The setup enables the identification and visualization of various microorganisms such as *daphnia*, *hydra*, *aspergillus*, *rhizopus*, *spirogyra*, *volvox*, and *paramecium*. Images captured by the developed system were compared against those from a high-end METZ-779 microscope using intensity profile analysis.

## 🧪 Key Features

- 📱 Uses a smartphone camera for imaging and illumination
- 🔬 Captures microscope-quality images using a bifocal laser lens
- 💡 No external LED light source required
- 📊 Image comparison done using ImageJ for intensity profiling
- 💰 Extremely low cost (~₹200 INR)

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Fusion 360** – for 3D modeling of the setup
- **ImageJ** – for plotting intensity profiles
- **METZ-779 Microscope** – for validation and comparison

## 🔍 Microorganisms Studied

- Daphnia
- Hydra
- Aspergillus
- Rhizopus
- Spirogyra
- Volvox
- Paramecium

## 🧠 Result Summary

- Intensity profiles obtained from the developed system were **comparable** to those from the METZ-779 microscope.
- The system is capable of capturing **high-resolution images** suitable for academic and diagnostic use.
- The model demonstrated **potential as a point-of-care (POC) device**, especially in remote or under-resourced regions.

## 📦 Future Work

- Integrate **machine learning** for noise reduction and automatic microbe classification.
- Replace the plywood prototype with a **3D-printed enclosure** for better durability and portability.
- Expand the use case to include **live tissues and other sample types**.
